1. **Entities and Transformations**: Maltego operates on the concept of entities and transformations. Entities are pieces of information such as domain names, IP addresses, email addresses, persons, companies, etc. Transformations are the operations performed on these entities to gather more data or to uncover relationships between them.

2. **Types of Entities**: Maltego supports various types of entities categorized into different groups such as Infrastructure, Person, Location, Document, and Others. Some commonly used entities include Domain, Website, Email Address, Phone Number, Person, Company, Document, etc.

3. **Transformations**: Transformations are actions performed on entities to gather additional information or to establish relationships between entities. Maltego provides both built-in and custom transformations. Built-in transformations query various public data sources and APIs to gather information related to the selected entity. Custom transformations allow users to integrate with external data sources or APIs to fetch specific information.

4. **Graphical Representation**: Maltego visualizes the collected data and relationships in the form of a graph, making it easier for users to understand complex connections. Entities are represented as nodes, and relationships between entities are represented as edges. The graph can be manipulated, zoomed, and filtered to focus on specific aspects of the investigation.

5. **Collaboration**: Maltego enables collaboration among team members by allowing them to share graphs, entities, and investigation results. Users can export graphs in various formats for sharing or further analysis.

6. **Maltego Transforms Hub**: The Transforms Hub is a marketplace within Maltego where users can discover, install, and purchase additional transforms to extend Maltego's functionality. These transforms provide access to a wide range of data sources, including social media platforms, public databases, and commercial threat intelligence feeds.

The Community Edition is free to use and offers limited functionality compared to the commercial editions. The commercial editions provide additional features such as more advanced transforms, larger graph sizes, and enhanced collaboration capabilities.
